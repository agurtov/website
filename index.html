        As Stripe’s products grow in complexity, most Sales-sold users 
        need some level of assistance to integrate quickly & properly. 
        To date, the Account Deployment team has provided 1:1 deployment 
        services via 3 channels: Stripe Deployment Strategists (“In-House Deployment”), 
        Stripe Onboarding Support Specialists (“Onboarding Lite”), and 
        3rd-party integration partners (“Partner Deployment”). 
        </p>
        <p paragraph-2>
        While we know that the majority of users require support during the 
        implementation phase, adoption of deployment services is not yet 
        widespread across the Sales-sold user pool. The largest contributing 
        factor is that Stripe is not able to scale 1:1 implementation support 
        indefinitely. It’s neither feasible nor cost-effective for Stripe to 
        scale Deployment Strategist and Onboarding Support Specialist headcount 
        at the same rate as AE/user demand. While some users will always need 
        Stripe-staffed deployment support, we also need to invest in services 
        with a higher support ratio.
        </p>
        <p paragraph-3>
        The bottom line: Low deployment service adoption results in suboptimal 
        experiences for Stripe Account Executives and users. AEs often 
        provide technical support to users that do not adopt deployment services, 
        reducing bandwidth to perform their core role. Complex users without 
        expert deployment support are at risk of building suboptimal (or even 
        risky) integrations, and all users without support miss out on guidance 
        that could expedite their Stripe launch.
